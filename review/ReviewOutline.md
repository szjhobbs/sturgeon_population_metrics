  - data caveats & data gaps

## Comments

  - known issues with study (e.g., staffing; funding; geographic)
  - how program aligns with current IEP monitoring goals and directives
  - community dynamics study could inform
  - proposed changes (if any; or) change of study’s scope (e.g., from
    more traditional fisheries metrics to predation-based studies)
  - what we’ve learned from current program (are data collected to date
    helpful?)
  - future (recommended changes for improvement and (or) a more robust program)
