## Overview

Directory `data` houses datafiles (mostly `.rds`) containing CA-based sturgeon data. Data have been and continue to be collected by the CDFW (Stockton; unless noted otherwise). Each data directory has a `data-log` file noting when (date & time) and from where (database or other data file) extraction occurred.

Stockton (Bay-Delta) CDFW personnel `push` data to GitHub periodically, but some data do change daily. See appropriate `data-log` file for details. Data are 'cleaned' prior to pushing. See `Metadata` in each data file for details about 'cleaning.'

## Directories

- [`baystudy`](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study)  
- `card`  
- `cpfv`  
- [`salvage`](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Salvage-Monitoring)   
- [`tagging`](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Sturgeon-Study)  

Links (to some above) provide more information about study & data collection. `card` & `cpfv` datasets are fishery-dependent (i.e., angler reported).
