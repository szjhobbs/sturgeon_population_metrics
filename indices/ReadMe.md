## Overview

This directory contains analytics about sturgeon year-class indices (YCI). Here we calculate YCI using [Bay Study](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study) data (as in [Fish 2010](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentId=26542&inline)) and present recently-developed calculations (and methods) using [Salvage](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Salvage-Monitoring) data (as in [Heublein et al. 2019](), in press).
