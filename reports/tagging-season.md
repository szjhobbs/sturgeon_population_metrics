## Field Season Summary

We set the net 168 times over 34 calendar days producing 127.2 hours
fishing time (\~10,700 net-fathom hours). Average fishing time per set
was about 45 ± 5.1 (SD) minutes. Nets were set an average of 5 times per
day per research vessel (one vessel\[s\] used this season).

We caught 272 (269 WST, 3 GST) sturgeon this season. Of the White
Sturgeon, 177 were then PIT & disc tagged, 55 disc tagged only, and 19
PIT tagged only. Of the Green Sturgeon, 2 were then PIT tagged. Of the
sturgeon catch, 18 White Sturgeon and 1 Green Sturgeon received no tag.
We recorded no recaptures this season.

## Sampling Effort and Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)

<!-- narrative here -->

#### Daily (Current Field Season)

Average daily CPUE for legal-sized (102-152 cm FL) White Sturgeon was
1.30 ± 0.16 (SE) and for all sizes of White Sturgeon was 2.51 ± 0.31
(SE). Average daily CPUE per drift (net set) for all sizes of White
Sturgeon was greatest on 29-Aug (7.21 ± 2.82 (SE); Figure below).

#### Annual (All Field Seasons)

Average monthly CPUE for all sizes of White Sturgeon declined during our
field season: 4.76 (Aug; n=38); 2.63 (Sep; n=40); 1.53 (Oct; n=71); 1.03
(Nov; n=19) . Catch per 100 net-fathom hour of White Sturgeon within the
current slot limit (102-152 cm FL) was 1.28 ± 0.13 (SE), a value below
the historical (period) average of 2.5, but comparable to the prior
sampling year (2017).

## Pinnipeds

In Suisun Bay, we observed a per-set average of 0.02 (± 0.18 SD) sea
lions and 0.03 (± 0.16 SD) seals within 50 meters of the net. We
observed pinnipeds raiding the net during 0% (sea lions) and 0.63%
(seals) of net sets. In San Pablo Bay, we encountered no pinnipeds.

## Collaboration

For the San Francisco Estuary Institute, we collected muslce plugs from
81 White Sturgeon with fork lengths 63-187 cm (Figure below).
