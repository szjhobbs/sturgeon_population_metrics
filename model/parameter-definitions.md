## Age-0 Recruitment
annual number of age-0 fish (produced from the model based on potential number of eggs per year per female per age class)

## Recruitment
period (in years) of successful age-classes (e.g., 5 denotes successful recruitment once every 5 years)

## Annual Survival Rate (ASR)
annual survival rate for segment not affected by harvest; model assumes a constant rate for this segment; value usually calculated via catch curve or Chapman-Robson methods

## ASR Standard Error (or Deviation)
some measure of variance on ASR

## Abundance
absolute abundance estimates typically derived from mark-recapture and report card data

## Annual Harvest Rate
for segment harvested annually and calculated using mark-recapture data, where recaptures are angler tag returns; value should be adjusted for non-response using appropriate methods

## Harvestable Ages
ages affected by harvest; because harvest regulations are set on length, one must use some conversion between age and length; current regs allow harvest of 40-60 inches fork length (or roughly ages 10-15 given current age-at-length growth model)

## Fraction Females
segment (or fraction) of population that is female

## Maturity
fraction of mature females spawning annually

## Data
age & length data that drives the model; for now this is CDFW-collected data from 2014-2016

## Simulations
the model is stochastic, so this sets the number of simulations or model iterations

## Confidence Interval
sets the desired confidence interval (CI) for lambda (population growth rate); for now CIs based on sample quantiles

## Gear Selectivity

## Period
