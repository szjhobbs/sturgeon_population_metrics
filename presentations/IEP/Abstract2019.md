We use multiple fishery-dependent and fishery-independent datasets to estimate population metrics such as abundance and mortality and to derive long term trends for both White Sturgeon (*Acipenser transmontanus*) and Green Sturgeon (*A. medirostis*).

Data from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s (CDFW) San Francisco Bay Study provide a reliable White Sturgeon year class index (YCI). Recently, Heublein et al. (in press) used state and federal fish salvage data (and Bay Study methodology) to calculate a similar index. Initial results indicate correlation between YCI and some indices for older age groups calculated from the datasets. Required since 2007, the Sturgeon Fishing Report Card (card) provides annual counts of White Sturgeon harvested (kept) and released. Card data for 2013-2017 show increasing harvest of White Sturgeon.

Card data also augment the CDFW’s long-running mark-recapture dataset, which provides estimates of abundance, exploitation, mortality, and length (or age) composition. 2013-2017 tagging data indicate strong cohorts within the legally-harvestable size range have diminished, progression of the strong 2006 cohort toward and now within harvestable size range, and indicate a modest 2011 cohort, just beginning to be caught.

Recent modeling (Blackburn et al. 2018) using these and other data indicated a declining population growth rate given current harvest levels. The CDFW is currently using this model to better understand long-range effects of exploitation on the White Sturgeon fishery and to potentially guide changes to current fishing regulations.
